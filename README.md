**Project for DFA and PDA**

DFA:  

We define the language L to consist of strings that represent certain email addresses  
(specified in Project 1 Doc). For this assignment I design a DFA that will recognize language L and wrote  
a program in C++ that implements my DFA.

PDA:  
We define the language A to be a particular set of strings (defined below) that represent  
valid arithmetic expressions operating on floating-point numbers, with the entire expression contained between specified delimiters %.   
For this assignment I design a PDA that recognizes this language and wrote a program in Python that implements my PDA.
